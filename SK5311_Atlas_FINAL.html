        <h1>Washington D.C. has a long and complex history shaped by segregation and exclusionary policies that have left an indelible mark on its neighborhoods and communities. From the institutionalized practices of redlining to discriminatory federal housing policies, these historical forces have entrenched patterns of racial and economic inequality. While such practices are no longer as overt, their effects continue to manifest in subtler forms, perpetuating displacement and gentrification. These legacies are evident in the city’s spatial patterns, where rising property values and redevelopment projects, such as Navy Yard, often lead to the dislocation of historically Black communities. This analysis aims to visualize the remnants of inequitable policies and explores Navy Yard as a case study of how subtle, yet intentional, forces of exclusion and displacement persist in reshaping the District.</h1>

</section>
<h2>The Federal Housing Administration Grading Map (1937)</h2>
<p>The FHA was established in 1934 to subsidize private development of new housing development and encourage homeownership by unsuring mortgage loans. The grading map that they produced essentailly institutionalized race as a criterion for loan approvals. Prologue DC found that since the Administration's inception to 1964, 98% of loans that were approved were given to white residents. The georeferenced map is not color coded, but Grades A-E were given graduated shades of green (which are the darker geographies on the FHA Grading Map and concentrated in the northwestern portion of the Distrct) and were associated with white communities. The grades starting from G are represented in shades of red, and represented the lowest grade of residential property, which helped white residents know which neighborhoods to avoid. Although out-right discriminatory tools, such as this FHA Grading Map is now illegal, the spatial patterns that exist today still reflect the impacts of these discriminatory policies. The following interactive maps allow the user to explore spatial patterns between the FHA Grading Map and sociodeomographic characteristics such as the distribution of Census Tracts by Percent Black Population and Median Household Income (ACS 2018-2022 5 Year Estimates). </p>
<p>The Anacostia River is intentionally highlighted in these maps to further show the difference in sociodemographic characteristics East and West of the River. "East of the River" has been a term to describe Ward 7 and 8, which are also where there is a concentration of Black communitiess. Over time, they have been pushed toward the East and to the edges of Washington DC. This river plays a symbolic role in underscoring the divided landscape that can be seen from above. </p>

<h3>Case Study: Navy Yard</h3>
<p>Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in Southeast Washington DC and sits north of the Anacostia River. This Riverfront neighborhood was once home to the Washington Navy Yard, and was an important employer for African American Communities. With the implementation of the Navy Yard Metro Station and the National Parks baseball stadium, many existing residents were "compensated" to leave and many of the historical dwellings were demolished to make room for new units and residents. This section of this analysis will explore a localized example of how Black communities in the District were displaced with an influx of white residents. The Anacostia River, and the location that it is situated, plays a unique symbolic role in highlighting the disparities that are visible from above. </p>

<h2>Project Limitations and Future Exploration</h2>
<p>Visualizing spatial analysis through interactive mapping is a powerful tool that I hope to continue to explore in the future. It has allowed me to georeference historical data and make comparisons with more current data, which can be difficult to do just with static mapping practices. A limitation to using historical data for this project is that it is difficult to analyze change over time given that boundaries are constantly shifting. Socio-demographic analysis was conducted at the Census Tract level, which may have been too big for the scale of Washington DC., however, finding datasets that had information for both 2012 and 2022 made it difficult to compare change over time. Census Tracts change over time and using Census Blocks was not an option given the limited datasets. Additionally, there is a plethora of interactive mapping tools, historical analysis, and literature on the fragmanted nature of the Districts landscape due to racially discriminatory practices. I felt as though I was only looking for data that would support the arguements that have already been being made, and I hope to tune into some of the other questions and explorations that I was unable to pursue for this project. WHile the remnants of discriminatory practices still persist in the Districts landscape, there are still strong cultural ties in Historically Black Neighborhoods and many cultural enclaves have grown since the District's inception. Exploring the birth of these enclaves and how they came to be, as well as how Black residents preserve culture and a sense of community could be fruitful and insight future research explorations. conducted on This webpage was developed using Javascript programming in Visual Studio Code and Mapbox.</p>
